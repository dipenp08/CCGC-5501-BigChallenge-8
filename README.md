Challenge Overview

This challenge involved retrieving a sensitive secret in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and AWS Secrets Manager to receive a flag. Participants began with a pre-established IAM user, ctf-starting-user, which had been granted access by three targeted IAM policies. The challenge was not only regarding the technical aspects of retrieving secrets but also about having a clear comprehension of AWS permissions and using CloudFox efficiently.

Challenge Setup and Key Components:
 User Permissions:
  SecurityAudit (AWS Managed): Provided comprehensive read-only access to AWS resources.
  CloudFox (Customer Managed): Enabled the use of the CloudFox tool for efficient interaction with AWS services.
  its-a-secret (Customer Managed): Allowed access to retrieve the secret stored within AWS Secrets Manager and SSM.
  
•	Tool and Profile Utilization:
The CloudFox tool was central to this challenge, with the cloudfoxable profile used to enumerate and inspect AWS resources and permissions.

Steps Undertaken:

1.	Identity Verification:
The process commenced by confirming the identity of the active user via the AWS CLI
 
aws --profile cloudfoxable sts get-caller-identity

2.	Secret Enumeration:
CloudFox was employed to list the secrets within the AWS account:

cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable secrets -v2
This command identified several secrets, including the target secret: /cloudfoxable/flag/its-a-secret.

3.	Secret Retrieval:
The next step involved accessing the secret from SSM using the following AWS CLI

aws --profile cloudfoxable --region us-west-2 ssm get-parameter --with-decryption --name /cloudfoxable/flag/its-a-secret

The execution of this command successfully returned the flag:

FLAG{ItsASecret::IsASecretASecretIfTooManyPeopleHaveAccessToIt?}

4.	Permission Analysis:
To ensure that the permissions were correctly configured, CloudFox was used to examine the IAM permissions of ctf-starting-user:

cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable permissions --principal ctf-starting-user -v2

This verification step confirmed that the attached policies provided the necessary access to retrieve the secret.

Reflective Insights:

  •Systematic Approach:
The challenge was addressed by adopting a systematic, step-by-step approach—from verifying user identity to enumerating secrets and ultimately retrieving the target secret. This ensured each step got verified and authenticated.

  •IAM Permissions Navigated:
One of the most significant aspects of the challenge was understanding and leveraging the IAM policies. Breaking down and validating permissions using CloudFox proved to be crucial in establishing ctf-starting-user had requisite access permission.

Conclusion:

The Cloudfoaxiblode "Its A Secret" challenge was a great illustration of how careful IAM permission management, combined with the wise use of AWS tools like CloudFox, can give secure access to valuable secrets. The methodical approach taken in this exercise not only enabled successful flag retrieval but also provided valuable lessons in cloud environment security through the exercise of least privilege, constant monitoring, and secure access practices.
